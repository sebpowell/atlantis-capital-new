				<p>The price and value of investments mentioned and any income that might accrue could fall or rise or fluctuate. Past performance is not a guide to future performance. If an investment is denominated in a currency other than the base currency, changes in the rate of exchange may have an adverse effect on value, price or income.

				<p>This document may relate to investments or services of an entity/person outside the UK, or to other matters which are not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, or in respect of which the protections of the Financial Conduct Authority for retail clients and/or the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme may not be available.

				<p>Investments may have no public market or only a restricted secondary market. Where a secondary market exists, it is not possible to predict the price at which investments will trade in the market or whether such market will be liquid or illiquid. As such investments will not be listed or traded on any exchange, pricing information may be more difficult to obtain and the liquidity of the investments may be adversely affected. A holder may be able to realise value prior to an investment’s maturity date only at a price in an available secondary market.</p>
